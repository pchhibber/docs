## Considerations
When creating a feature list for a product, one can consider
* Could these be based on user goals & customer journeys?
* Could they be on different pricing models like SaaS products?
* Could each feature be introduced with a verb?
* Should the full feature list and the feature overviews be different?
* Should there be some difference between funcitonal and non-functional stuff?
